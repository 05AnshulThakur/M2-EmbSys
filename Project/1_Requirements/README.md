## Description:
In this Project we check the moisture content of the soil with the help of Sensor 
and If it is below the required value then the soil is irrigated.
An accurate amount of moisture is required in crops for their good and healthy growth.
Even gardens also require a accurate amount of moisture for the plants to grow and remain healthy.

## Application:
 
## Requirements:

### High Level Requiremnets:
| ID | Description | 
| ----- | ----- |
