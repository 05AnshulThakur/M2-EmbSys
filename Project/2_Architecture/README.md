### Explanation of Components:

### LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE:
A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it.

### TEMPERATURE SENSOR:
Temperature sensor is a device, used to measure the temperature using an electrical signal.

### MICROCONTROLLER:
It is the brain of the whole system. All the decision making and calculations are done by it.

### HEATER:
It will heat the seat.

### POWER SOURCE:
It provides power to the whole system to work according to the microcontroller:

### ACTUATOR (MOTOR):
It is used to irrigate the field with water.

### INPUT DEVICE:
It is used to give input values to the microcontroller.
