## MAGNETRON:
A magnetron is a device that uses the interaction of a stream of electrons, guided by a magnetic field, with cavities within a block of copper to produce microwave radiation (Basically it cooks food).

## LIGHT-EMITTING DIODE:
A light-emitting diode (LED) is a semiconductor light source that emits light when current flows through it.

## TEMPERATURE SENSOR:
Temperature sensor is a device, used to measure the temperature using an electrical signal.

## MICROCONTROLLER:
It is the brain of the whole system. All the decision making and calculations are done by it.

## RELAY:
A relay is an electromagnetic switch that opens and closes circuits.

## SENSOR (DOOR OPEN/CLOSE):
The sensor detects weather door is closed or not, If the door is not closed properly, microwave will not start cooking.

## AC POWER SOURCE:
The main source of energy which will provide power to the system. 

## DC VOLTAGE REGULATOR:
A DC Voltage Regulator is a device which maintains the output voltage of an ordinary power supply constant irrespective of load variations or changes in input A.C voltage.

## CLOCK:
The micro-controller has a clock simply because it executes sequential logic. Microcontrollers need to use a clock because they need to be able to respond to events that may occur at any time.

## BUTTONS:
Helps us to set Temp., Time, Mode of cooking and helps the user to operate the microwave oven.
